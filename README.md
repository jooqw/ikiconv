# ikiconv
IKI/IKI2 converter that works with FFmpeg, SoX and JPSXDEC

thanks to @Timkho for some fixes on the python script

## Requirements for linux:
- Use `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`and `sudo pacman -S sox` to install everything
- Name the jpsxdec folder exactly `jpsxdec_v2.0`

## Requirements for windows:

If you are going to use the release build, skip the requirements
-   Python 3
-   FFmpeg 6.0
-   jPSXdec v2.0

place `ffmpeg.exe` in the same directory as the python script

place the `JPSXdec 2.0` folder in the same directory as the python script
